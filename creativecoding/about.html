        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p><strong>Welcome to this creative piece developed through Creative Coding!</strong> This work is an example of using computer programming to create interactive art and graphics. By writing code to control various visual elements on the screen, this project showcases how technology and art can be combined. It is part of a computer graphics course that emphasizes nurturing creativity alongside programming skills, allowing learners to develop both their technical and artistic abilities.</p>
        <p>This project demonstrates how coding can be applied to produce dynamic and visually appealing graphic compositions, resulting in a unique digital art experience. You will see interactive graphics arranged and animated thoughtfully over a carefully crafted background, showcasing the seamless integration of computer graphics and creative expression.</p>
        <p>This work has been guided by <strong>Asst. Prof. Banyapon Poolsawas</strong> from College of Creative Design and Entertainment Technology, <strong>Dhurakij Pundit University</strong>, Thailand, who brings extensive experience and expertise in teaching computer graphics and digital design. Thank you for visiting, and we hope you enjoy exploring this creative coding project!</p>
